<tr align=center><td><font color="2f4d2a" size="4" face=TaHoma><i>Sahastradhara literally means 'thousand-fold spring'. It is a popular attraction, 
    famous for its medicinal & therapeutic value as its water contains sulphur. <br> <br> Also known as Sulphur Springs, this waterfall cascades through limestone 
    stalactites, making the water rich in sulphur. A dip in the Sulphur-rich water here feels cold and refreshing but is believed to have remarkable medicinal advantages. 
    The temperature of the water here is a little lower than its surroundings. Its picturesque beauty attracts a lot of travellers from faraway places. One can even enjoy a 
    stunning view of the mountains on a fun ropeway ride. </i> </font> </td>
